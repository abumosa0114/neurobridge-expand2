Practicum project for UNC SILS MSIS'24 graduates: Expanding NeuroBridge Ontology.

# Basics
The Neurobridge Ontology (NO) has terms that are used to identify the research design and data types of scientific papers. It is used in systems that search and return papers based on queries made by scientists. Some of the terms used in the NO are not defined. The goal of this project is to (i) identify NO terms used in the labeling of a corpus of papers, (ii) determine which have definitions already available, (iii) make new definitions for terms not already defined, (iv) develop a machine readable form for these definitions (make an Resource Description Framework/RDF file), and (v) add these definitions to the NeuroBridge system.
